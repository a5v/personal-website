Welcome to my website!!

> “and those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music”

There are currently three main aims for this website:
1. to showcase projects I've worked on
2. to share things I think others would find useful and/or interesting
3. to develop my technical skills with a fun project

Feel free to contact me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-vitarana/) :))
