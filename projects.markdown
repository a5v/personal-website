For personal growth reasons, I have tried to undertake a wide-variety of coding projects that span across data science, software engineering, and mathematical modelling, and expose me to a multiple programming languages & technologies. The projects are listed in no particular order or priority.

## Oxford Physics Labs

Series of physics-based data analysis projects, which I received a practical commendation for "excellence of laboratory practical work”.

Projects include investigations into:
- superconductivity (Python, Jupyter Notebook)
- the magnetophonon effect (Python, Jupyter Notebok)
- B mesons produced in proton-antiproton collisions (C++)
- colour magnitude diagrams (R, R Markdown)
- chaos (MATLAB)

The GitHub repo is available [here](https://github.com/a5v/oxford-physics-labs).

## The Drivers of Peak Warming

This is my Master project where I am carrying out an integrated modelling of the climate and the economy. I developed a novel iterative mathematical model of interactions between the climate and the economy (Python) and explored the impact of key assumptions in a benefit-cost maximisation approach to climate policy on the peak warming achieved and social cost of carbon (Jupyter Notebook). My project is being supervised by Professor Hannah Christensen, Professor Myles Allen, and Stuart Jenkins. The GitHub repo is available [here](https://github.com/a5v/drivers-of-peak-warming).

## Jane Street Market Prediction

This is was a Kaggle competition and was my first real project regarding deep learning that I had self-taught myself through online resources. I built a neural network, with TensorFlow backend, that predicts whether a stock market trade should be executed from a set of anonymised features (Python, Keras, Pandas). I was awarded a [bronze medal](https://www.kaggle.com/maxpower742) in the Kaggle competition.

## Modelling the Global Fossil Fuel Supply Chain Network

In Summer 2020, I spent six weeks as a data science intern at the Oxford Martin School doing research regarding the Economics of Sustainability. Here I implemented cutting-edge community detection algorithms on the global fossil fuel supply chain modelled as a min-cost flow network (Python, C++, GeoPandas). The GitHub repo is available [here](https://github.com/Lkruitwagen/global-fossil-fuel-supply-chain).

## Computational Particle Physics

In Summer 2019, I spent six weeks as a data science intern at the University of Birmingham as a Computational Particle Physics research intern. Here I simulated particle interactions in a spherical detector, using Monte Carlo methods, and statistically analysed experimental data (C++, Geant4, ROOT) and presented my findings to the research group on a weekly basis (LaTeX). I was supervised by Professor Kostas Nikolopoulos.

## Talent Tracker

This was a LawTech Hackathon at Barclays Eagle Labs, where my team developed a web application for trainee lawyers to manage workflow and develop emotional intelligence using natural language processing chatbot (HTML/CSS, Javascript, IBM Watson Assistant). We were awarded 2nd place in the Hackathon.

## Monitoring Aerosols above Clouds

This was my computational BA project on the influence of aerosols on the retrieval of cloud properties from satellite data (Python, FORTRAN, Azure). The GitHub repo to the modified Python wrapper is available [here](https://github.com/a5v/pyDISORT) and the GitHub repo to the project is available [here](https://github.com/a5v/aerosols-above-clouds).

## Serverless Slack App for Onboarding

In Summer 2021, I spent two months as a software engineering intern at the TNG Technology Consulting GmbH. Here I designed and implemented a serverless Slack application to improve the onboarding experience for new employees with interactive questions (Python, AWS CDK). This included the administration of a NoSQL database for storing user information, permissions, questions, and results (DynamoDB).

## PowerPoint Ghostwriter

In Autumn 2022, I spent two months as a software engineering intern at the TNG Technology Consulting GmbH. Here I Incorporated NLP transformer models, to generate text and images, into a 'PowerPoint Ghostwriter' that uses AI to compose and deliver a presentation on a given topic (JavaScript, GPT-3, DALL·E 2). In addition, I helped develop a web application using Svelte to facilitate interacting with the 'PowerPoint Ghostwriter' (HTML, CSS).
