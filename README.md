Hi! My name is Aaron Vitarana.

I am currently a fourth-year Physics student at the University of Oxford. Broadly speaking, I am interested in [complex systems](https://comprehensiblecomplexity.com).

My [GitHub](https://github.com/a5v) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/maxpower742) profiles.

Some [A Level Physics Notes](https://www.tes.com/teaching-resources/shop/thealevelphysicist).
