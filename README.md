# Personal Website

[https://a5v.github.io/personal-website](https://a5v.github.io/personal-website)

I created a personal website, using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), to share some things I have been thinking about. I used the [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme.

## To run the website locally

- Install Ruby
- Install Jekyll: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/
- Install gem bundler: gem install bundler
- bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
