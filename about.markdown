## "so, tell me about yourself..."

Hi, I'm Aaron :)) I am currently a final-year Physics student at the University of Oxford. I have a strong record of academic achievement having achieved the highest A Level results in my school and a first in each year at University. I chose to study Physics because I enjoy understanding how the world works and solving quantitative problems in a logical manner. I am a competent programmer having completed multiple projects through my degree, internships, and personal projects. I am particularly proficient in Python, but I have a wide-variety of languages; these projects span across data science, software engineering, mathematical modelling and their intersections. Speaking German at home and having worked for a German company, I have advanced proficiency in the German language. In my free-time I like undertaking activities that push me to improve myself. In particular throughout University I have enjoyed the challenges of rowing.


## some current interests

- understanding complex systems such as financial markets, biological systems, and the climate system (see [previous academic blog](https://comprehensiblecomplexity.com/))
- coding (see [projects](https://a5v.github.io/personal-website/projects/))
- sustainability
- creativity
- languages
- rowing (see photo below)

There are currently three main aims for this website:
1. to showcase projects I've worked on
2. to share things I think others would find useful and/or interesting
3. to develop my technical skills with a fun project
